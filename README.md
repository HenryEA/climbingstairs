## Climbing stairs algorithm
This repo contains the solution to the Climbing stairs problem which is as follows:
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

This repo has two solutions. First a recursive solution and then an optimized solution using the dynamic programming technique.
In addition, the algorithm can also read input and return output.
